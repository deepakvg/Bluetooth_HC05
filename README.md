Send Ultrasonic sensor data wirelessly using two Bluetooth modules
First the bluetooth modules have to be configured as master and slave respectively. 
In this code I have sent float values of ultrasonic sensor through bluetooh. You can edit the transmitter code to transfer other data types like string or character..
Happy coding
